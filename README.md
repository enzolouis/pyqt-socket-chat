# pyqt-socket-chat

A socket chat desktop app made with qt in python !

## What ?
This socket chat use threading module (not asyncio or async/await syntax).

It's a basic software that I will sometimes improve in order to progress with socket and asynchronous functionality.

## How to run the app ?
Currently, the "only" requirement are `PyQt6` and `pyyaml` so you
have to, at first, got Python, and install these two librairies with `py -m pip install <lib>` in command line.
After downloading the project, there is a `config.yaml`, you'll have to edit the first line with your own ipv4 (of the server)
Finally, run the server.py (once) and you can run clients on other computers...
