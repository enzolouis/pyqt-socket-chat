# pyqt-socket-chat

A socket chat desktop app made with qt in python !

This socket chat use threading module, not asyncio or async/await syntax yet.

It's a basic software that I will sometimes improve in order to progress with socket and asynchronous functionality.

Currently, the "only" requirement are `PyQt6` and `pyyaml`
